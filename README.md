## To do
-Management of user accounts: Every user will be able to access their own dashboard that allows them to send and receive AUCs, see the history of transactions, see list of pending payments, and top-up. 
-Top-up account: This function allows to a authenticated user to request AUCs to a pre-defined account in AIUTS. The AUCs are not sent to the requester until the requester pays cash to the owner of the account. The pre-defined account must belong to an authorized finance officer of AIU. 
-Request of payment: This function allows to a authenticated user to request AUCs to another AIUTS user by using their account address. The requests   of payments are listed in the charged user's dashboard.
-Search transactions: This function allows to a authenticated user to filter the history of transactions by account address and timestamp.
